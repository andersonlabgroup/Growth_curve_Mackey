This is a quick and easy script to take growth curve data and calculate doubling times using the five intervals with the maximum change in optical density (OD). 

The script requires a .csv file as input. This is generated from OD measurements taken during a time course of growth and should include time on one axis and the OD of the samples on the other axis. We perform growth curves in microtiter plates using a plate reader with orbital shaking.

The output that is produced provides the doubling time using the time scale provided alongside of the OD measurements.
